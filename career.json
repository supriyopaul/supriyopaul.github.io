    "narrativeSummary": "My journey in technology began with a deep curiosity for the internet and has evolved into a career dedicated to building robust, scalable, and efficient systems. From architecting high-throughput data pipelines and MLOps platforms to developing full-stack AI applications, I thrive on solving complex problems. I am an aspiring system architect who believes in clean, maintainable code as the foundation of any great product. Throughout my journey, I've balanced my deep focus in technology with a love for creative outlets. I'm an avid anime fan, a proficient cook, and even had a short stint designing and selling stickers. My thinking is often shaped by authors like Yuval Noah Harari and Paulo Coelho, whose works encourage looking at the bigger picture—a principle I apply to both my life and my work.",
