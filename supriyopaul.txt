Hi, my name is <span id="k">Supriyo Paul</span>. <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

This is the portflio website.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I hope you like it.</p>

<p>I was a technologically-inclined person from very early stages of my life. I love learning new things and having new experiences.  I spend most of my leisure time either reading forums or watching videos about new advancements in the tech world or organising my personal things.I can efficiently interpret user requirements and implement them into the application due to my keen understanding of backend architecture of various systems, thanks to my job experience in a variety of
domains. Cleanliness, quality and automation is what drives most of my development work. I also like to play football and volleyball, watch movies and listening to a very specific genre of Indian music.</p> <!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
