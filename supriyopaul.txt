Hi, my name is <span id="k">Supriyo Paul</span>. <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

This is the portflio website.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I hope you like it.</p>

<p>I was a technologically-inclined person from very early stages of my life. I love learning new things and having new experiences.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> I spend most of my leisure time either reading forums or watching videos about new advancements in the tech world or organising my personal things. <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->I can efficiently interpret user requirements and implement them into the application due to my keen understanding of backend architecture of various systems, thanks to my job experience in a variety of
domains.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> Cleanliness, quality and automation is what drives most of my development work. I also like to play football and volleyball, watch movies and listening to a very specific genre of Indian music.</p> <!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
